    notesToReviewer: |
      This extension is open source at https://github.com/felixfbecker/svg-screenshots

      Needed to build:
      NodeJS ^15.2.0
      NPM ^7.0.8

      Install dependencies with `npm install`.
      To build the extension into the dist/ folder run: npm run build
      To then build an extension ZIP for Firefox, run afterwards: npm run firefox:build
      The extension ZIP will be placed in `web-ext-artifacts/`.

      The extension contributes an action button that opens a popup. From there, you can select further actions to take a screenshot of the current page (Example: www.google.com).

      Permissions:
      - The extension needs the all_urls permission because it needs to fetch images and fonts from webpages in the background page to inline them as Base64 into the SVG.
      - It uses `storage` to persist user settings.

      The warning about usage of the `Function` constructor is a popular polyfill for Function.prototype.bind in the dependency chain.
