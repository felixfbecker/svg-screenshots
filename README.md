# SVG Screenshots Browser Extension

Browser extension to take semantic, accessible screenshots of websites, as SVG - as simple as taking a PNG screenshot.

## Features

Offers various benefits over normal PNG screenshots, while keeping the good parts:

- **Flexible**: Select the region of the website you want to capture.
- **Scalable graphics**: Screenshots never get pixelated when zooming in.
- **Semantic**: Text can still be selected and copied to clipboard.
- **Accessible**: SVG is annotated with ARIA attributes and can be read by screen readers.
- **Paste into design tools**: SVGs will work in design tools like Illustrator, Figma, Sketch etc.
- **Interactive**: Links are still clickable.
- **Self-contained**: Inlines external resources like images, fonts, etc.
- **Static**: Styles and layout are recorded at the time of snapshot and will not change when viewed on different machines.
